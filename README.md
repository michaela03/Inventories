# Inventories
This is a web application that allows the processing of stock data from a server in a wholesale warehouse. 
The app is developed with ASP.NET CORE MVC and performs basic CRUD operations on the data. There is also an option to search by a product name. Each user can create a profile. If the user has not registered he cannot see the deliveries. When logged in, different operations on the products are allowed.
